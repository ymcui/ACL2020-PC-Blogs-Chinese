# PC Blog Post Six Days Before Deadline!
We are only six days away from the submission deadline!!  ACL 2020 is experimenting with several new implementations to keep up with the growing number of submissions. First of all,  we would like to thank you for your patience and cooperation!

Here are a couple reminders/clarifications regarding the Global Profile and the Author/Reviewer information form. 

### Do I need to fill both Global Profile and Author/Reviewer information form?

Yes. [Global Profile](https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/papers/user/) is within the START system which hosts many other conferences (including ACL related conferences). The [Author/Reviewer information](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=9028kaqAQ0OMdrEjlJf7WV1_1tZ1K-JCmL49YyhKe89UQTczV0xMNVhZSzhaWjVaNzJIS0U2MzNXUy4u) form collects information specifically for ACL2020. With your permission, information from this form may be passed down to future ACL related conferences. 

### Is it mandatory to provide my “Semantic Scholar ID”  in both the Global Profile and the Author/Reviewer information form? 

Yes. It is mandatory to provide your Semantic Scholar ID which allows the automatic detection of COI and reviewer assignment (please check [this blog](https://acl2020.org/blog/conflict-of-interest/) from Amanda Stent and Graham Neubig for details). In addition, these two boxes in the Global Profile are crucial:
- Affiliations - Past and Present
- Please enter the Semantic Scholar IDs of everyone who may be biased in reviewing your submission.

In the Global Profile, if a field does not apply to you, please leave it blank. 

Here is some information from Semantic Scholar about how to find a Semantic Scholar profile ID: One way to do this is to type “Semantic Scholar” and your name into a search engine of your choice, and find the returned profile that corresponds to you. Another option is to find one of your papers on [www.semanticscholar.org](https://acl2020.org/blog/conflict-of-interest/www.semanticscholar.org), and click on your name, or you can search for your name on Semantic Scholar and pick the page with most of your work from the author panel on the right-hand side of the search results.

Your Semantic Scholar ID is an url.  For example, Noam Chomsky's is [https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Noam-Chomsky/2329142](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Noam-Chomsky/2329142).

You can add or remove papers by claiming your profile (click on “CLAIM AUTHOR PAGE”) and fix paper details using the “Contact” button on the top right of the page. Feel free to contact [Semantic Scholar Support](mailto:feedback@semanticscholar.org) with questions or concerns.

### I filled the Author/Reviewer information form, will I get a confirmation? Can I update the form after I submit it? 

Please make sure you hit the “submit” button. Once you submit your form, you should receive an immediate confirmation that “Your response was submitted”. If you absolutely have to change your form, please fill in another form with the same START ID.

### How do I know if my or my co-author’s profiles were filled in correctly?

You and your co-authors can always check your respective Global Profile anytime. Unfortunately, for the author/reviewer information form, there is not a direct way to know whether the forms are filled correctly. What you (the main author) can do is to communicate with your co-authors (which should be the case when you put together a paper anyway) and make sure they have filled the forms. After the submission deadline, we will be in touch with you if there is any problem.
